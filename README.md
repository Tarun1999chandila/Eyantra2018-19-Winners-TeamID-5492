# Eyantra2018-19
Includes ROS, image processing and PID

This projects imitates the behaviour of pollinator bee. As the bee goes from flower to flower and pollinates them, here the drone(PlutoX) takes off from beehive, goes to each flower, pollinates them and lands back to the beehive.

Major challenges in this theme:

1. PID tuning
2. Waypoint Navigation
3. Avoiding Collision with flower
4. Increasing probability of pollination
5. Landing of drone
